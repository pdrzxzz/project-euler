# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the problems from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net).

The problems focus on mathematics, logic, and programming. I'm solving them as a way to practice creativity, algorithmic thinking and computational problem-solving.

## Structure

Each file corresponds to the solution of a specific problem number from the site. Solutions are written in Python.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These solutions are for educational purposes only and represent my own approach to learning.
